# My vim colorscheme

**Dim** is a clone of Vimâ€™s default colorscheme, with some improvements.
It comes from [this](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim) repo.

This version changes the tabbar theming and removes the inversion from
visual mode so the look fits my liking.
You can check out my whole config that uses the theme
[here](https://github.com/MaciejZj/Dotfiles).
